\section*{Question 5: Symbolic algebra with python}

In the first lecture on linear programming, the brute force
method of solving linear programs was shows. This required
4 simultaneous equations with 4 variables to be solved.
Maple was used solve the equatiions in the lecture. 

Python has a library which can do symbolic 
manipulations called SymPy
(\url{https://www.sympy.org/en/index.html}).
The script \textbf{Q5\_hint.py} uses SymPy to solve

\begin{eqnarray}
3 x_1 + x_2 - x_3 & = & 10 \nonumber \\
x_1 + x_2 - 2x_3 & = & 4 \nonumber \\
\end{eqnarray}
The $x_3$ variable is set to zero at the end, because
this is how it is used in the linear programming example.

Modify the script \textbf{Q5\_hint.py} on the DLE so that 
it solves the problem on page 22 of the lecture notes. 
There is useful documentation at \url{https://docs.sympy.org/1.5.1/tutorial/index.html}.
