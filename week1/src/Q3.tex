\section*{Question 3:Linear algebra with python}

In this exercise you will investigate using 
python to solve linear algebra problems.
Download the python script
\textbf{Q3\_lab1\_hint.py}
from the DLE and run it.
The standard way to work with matrices and vectors
in python is to use the numpy library. See
\url{https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/matrix}.

\begin{itemize}

\item The script first computes the dot product $v^T u$ of two vectors. 
      Check the result by hand and compute the magnitude of 
      both vectors $\sqrt{u^T u} $ and $\sqrt{v^T v} $.


\item The script computes a 3 by 3 matrix with random elements between
  0 and 1. The eigenvectors and eigenvalues of the matrix are computed. 
  Write some python to check that the eigenvalues and eigenvectors are
  correct \textbf{$R \underline{v} = \lambda \underline{v} $}.


\item By taking suitable combinations of the matrix \textbf{R} write code to generate a
      random matrix with only positive eigenvalues. You should run the
      script at least 5 times to check it.

\end{itemize}

Random matrices have many applications in mathematics and physics.
