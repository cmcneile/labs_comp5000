\section*{Question 4: Statistical analysis with python}


The Guardian newspaper makes data sets availabe
in a format, which can be read both by Excel
and Matlab. See the analysis by the Guardian.

The file \textbf{North sea oil rig spills - ALL INCIDENTS.csv}
available on the DLE contains a spreadsheet with the data about
oil spills in the North Sea.

The python script \textbf{Q4\_lab1\_hint.py}  contains some code
to load in the data from the spreadsheet.


\begin{itemize}

\item Download both the script and Excel file from the DLE. Run the 
      script in spyder.

\item Use the documentation to compute mean, sum, and standard deviation of 
      the \textbf{leakage} array, which has the material spilt for each incident. 

\item Plot a histogram of the \textbf{leakage} array.

\item The \textbf{Severity} column of the spreadsheet classifies the
  spill as either Significant or Minor. Write some code to count the
  number of Significant or Minor oil spills in the spreadsheet and to
  compute the percentage of Significant spills.
      

\end{itemize}
