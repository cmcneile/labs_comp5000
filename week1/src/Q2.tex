\section*{Question 2: python revision}

As a warm up for doing simple calculations with python.
consider the sum of the square of $n$ integers.

$$
S_n = \sum_{i=0}^{n} i^2
$$

The value of $S_n$ can be computed explicitly:
$$
S_n = \frac{1}{6} n (n+1) (2n+1)
$$

However, for an application we are interested in, the 
standard deviation ($\sigma$)
of the series of the sum of the squares
of the integers is required to be computed.
The series is defined by
$$
x_i = i^2
$$
where $i$ ranges from 1 to n.

$$
\sigma_n = \sqrt{ \frac{1}{n}  \sum_{i=1}^{n} ( x_i - \overline{x} )^2      }
$$
where  $\overline{x}$ is the mean of the sequence.


On the DLE is a python script \textbf{Q2\_lab1\_hint.py} which implements the above,
but the lines are in the wrong order. Reorder the lines of code so
that the above is implemented.  Test the script by computing $S_n$
and $\sigma_n$ for $n=4$.
